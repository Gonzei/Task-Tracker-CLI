# Task CLI

This is a simple command-line tool to help you keep track of tasks. You can add tasks, update them, delete them, and mark them as in-progress or done. It saves everything in a JSON file so your tasks donâ€™t disappear when you close the terminal.

---

## How to Run It

Make sure you have Python installed.

Then just run the script like this:

```bash
python task-cli.py add "Buy groceries"
```
